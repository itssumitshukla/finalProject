Personal project
* 
```
1 Code: Html5, css3, bootstrap, ES6, jquery (minimal), firebase ( noSql db )
2 Used firebase auth to login and image storage
3 Most of the code is vanilla javascript
```

## Unfinished business
* Website isnt as mobile responsive as i would have liked
* Storage app needs to be reconfigured
* Webapp auth isnt properly configured (oath isnt working properly) and only works with assigned email value
